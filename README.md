# Vermilion
A custom Fedora Atomic [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) image based on [Universal Blue's image-template](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template) & [Bazzite KDE](https://bazzite.gg).

##### [!] Warning [!]: This is very much a work in progress, made for myself & friends, *and* I'm very new to this. So if you do use it and something breaks I might not be able to help :( 

# Features

* Niri+DMS & KDE Desktops
* All the usual Bazzite & uBlue stuff
* Native Discord for game activity to work
* Vivaldi Browser
* Docker
* ???
